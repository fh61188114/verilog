                                         Design of a Traffic Light Controller
 /*programmable values to red/yellow/green light.
 TLC can be placed in various modes(blinking mde, high traffic mode, low traffic mode, manual mode).
 has FF which stores the mode.
 has FF which stores time value.(Configuration Registers-Read Write Registers)
 has FF that indicates the status of the TLC, FF are implemented as Registers(Status Register-Read only).
 32 bits of FF constiture Register and each register has an unique address.
 reg [31:0] mode_reg; // [31:3] reserved bits, [2:0] mode selection bits.
 
 modes
	mode = 000 => switched off mode
	mode = 001 => high traffic mode
	mode = 010 => low traffic mode
	mode = 011 => manual mode
	mode = 100 => blinking mode
 
 reg [31:0] red_time_reg; // [7:0] : value, [31:8] : reserved
 reg [31:0] green_time_reg; // [7:0] : value, [31:8] : reserved
 reg [31:0] yellow_time_reg; // [7:0] : value, [31:8] : reserved

 Addressing Registers
 	Byte Addressing
 mode_reg => 8'h00 (00 to 03)
 red_time_reg => 8'h04 (04 to 07)
 yellow_time_reg => 8'h08 (08 to 0B)
 green_time_reg => 8'h0C (0C to 0F)
 status_reg => 8'h10 

 to acces register, we need protocols(tell them how read/write will happen).
 Protocols :
 	- on chip protocol
		AXI, AHB, APB, OCP
	- Peripheral communication protocols
		USB, PCIe, UART, I2C.
 APB Protocol:
 	paddres
	pwite_data(read will come through 'prdata')
	pwrite
	penable
	pready
	psel  (master selects slave by enabling this/ tell slave to be ready)
	pclk, prst.
